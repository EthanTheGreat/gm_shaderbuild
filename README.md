Step 1) Install: https://github.com/ficool2/sdk_screenspace_shaders
Step 2) Apply existing addon into the root folder, of the above repository. 
Step 3) Adjust game path within `process_shaders_single_30.ps1` relative to the game paths described @ lines 13-15

Please Modify the ps1 file with the following folder paths:
        <garrysmod>/<garrysmod>/materials/effects/shaders
        <garrysmod>/<garrysmod>/shaders/fxc
        <ToolDir>/materials/effects/shaders/template
