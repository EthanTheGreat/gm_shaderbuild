Step 3) Adjust game path within `process_shaders_single_30.ps1` relative to the game paths described @ lines 13-15
        If you're game's relative path is different, please locate them and change the lines to match your project.

        This should be the path to your materials folder, shader path and your local version (within the setup of step 1) the material file template.

Step 4) Attach the following code bracket to the vscode setup we're using (Thanks Ficool!)
The file should be called: "TASKS.JSON" which is located in the main '.vscode' folder.


```
        {
            "label": "Build Shader (FAST)",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "powershell",
            "args": [
                "-NoLogo",
                "-ExecutionPolicy",
                "Bypass",
                "-Command",
                "bin\\process_shaders_single_30.ps1"
                "${file}"
            ],
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "always",
                "panel": "shared"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [],
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/shadersrc"
            }
        },
```
